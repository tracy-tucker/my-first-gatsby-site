 gatsby new - new project

 gatsby develop - launch local server

 page component - contains all UI elements for a specific page of your site (Home, About)

 building-block component - smaller components that represent just a part of a page's UI (instead of an entire page). (Navbar, Sidebar, etc.)

 pre-built component - maintained by another package (such as Gatsby). You can import it and use it without knowing what's under the hood (Link)

 Gatsby is already configured with GraphQL and CSS Modules

 Plugin Notes:
 - install it.
 - add it to the `gatsby-config.js` file
