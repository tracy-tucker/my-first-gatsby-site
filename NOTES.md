 gatsby new - new project

 gatsby develop - launch local server

 page component - contains all UI elements for a specific page of your site (Home, About)

 building-block component - smaller components that represent just a part of a page's UI (instead of an entire page). (Navbar, Sidebar, etc.)

 pre-built component - maintained by another package (such as Gatsby). You can import it and use it without knowing what's under the hood (Link)

 Gatsby is already configured with GraphQL and CSS Modules
