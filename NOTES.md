 gatsby new - new project

 gatsby develop - launch local server

 page component - contains all UI elements for a specific page of your site (Home, About)

 building-block component - smaller components that represent just a part of a page's UI (instead of an entire page). (Navbar, Sidebar, etc.)

 pre-built component - maintained by another package (such as Gatsby). You can import it and use it without knowing what's under the hood (Link)

 Gatsby is already configured with GraphQL and CSS Modules

 ## Plugins Used:
 - gatsby-plugin-image - responsive images
 - gatsby-plugin-sharp - dependency for gatsby-plugin-image
 - gatsby-source-filesystem - creates file nodes from files
 - gatsby-mdx-plugin - transformer plugin. see notes below.
 - @mdx-js/mdx - mdx plugin dependency
 - @mdx-js/react - mdx plugin dependency

 ### Plugin Notes:
 - install it.
 - add it to the `gatsby-config.js` file

 gatsby-source-filesystem -- lets you query data ABOUT the files,  but doesn't let you use the data INSIDE the files themselves.

 gatsby-plugin-mdx -- a transformer plugin! This takes the raw content from source plugins and TRANSFORMS it into something usable. gatsby-plugin-mdx specifically allows Markdown and JSX along side text content. gatsby-plugin-mdx will transform *file* nodes that have the `.mdx` extension into MDX nodes, which have a different set of fields that you can query using GraphQL.

 GraphQL Notes:
 useStaticQuery -> a pre-defined hook that lets you add GraphQL queries to BUILDING-BLOCK components. useStaticQuery allows you to define the query INSIDE the component. It takes 1 parameter: a templated string. It returns the requested data, which you can then store in a variable and use throughout the component.
 You can only call useStaticQuery once per file. If you need multiple fields, you can add them all into a single query.

 graphql -> in PAGE components, the useStaticQuery hook is not needed. You will do a basic page query using graphql alone. Also, your Graphql query needs to be defined OUTSIDE of the page component. Doing this will create a prop called `data`, which will hold the resulting data from the Graphql query.

 nodes -> In Graphql, inside the data layouer, information is stored in objects called *nodes*. Nodes are the smalled form unit of data in the data layer. Different source plugins create different types of nodes, each with their own properties. EX: gatsby-source-filesystem creates *file* nodes.

 MDX = Markdown Language
 Frontmatter = additional metadata. Not rendered.
 Frontmatter example:
 ---
 name: "Fun Facts about Red Pandas"
 datePublished: "2021-07-12"
 auther; "#1 Red Panda Fan"
 ---

 `allMdx` and `mdx` = fields for GraphQL queries
 `MDXRenderer` component = for processing and displaying MDX content
